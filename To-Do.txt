Checklist and dev notes :)

[] Make sure writing in intro is elaborated on 
[] List methods and basic function

[] make sure exceptions are good

[] Algorithms under exceptions are made by gpt so make sure they are good and figure out if they are actually needed or if they can be implemented in method
    [] Figure out what 'Iterator' is cuz idk

[] complete method logic
    [] probably going to have to create an output variable to print the output to.
        - Same thing I did as the last project, its pretty simple, but just going through the code and making adjustments will take time
    [] M variable ~ Check with prof/TAs to see what the proper M is for values and children
    [] Insert Method ~ look at instructions to see if repeated values are allowed or not (insert method)
    [] split_node Method ~ I have it splitting into a left and right node at the moment, but I'm not sure if thats right, 
        - Idea: splitting into left and right may not be applicable for all sizes of M, but I'm not 100% sure
            * look through instructions for clarifications, but probably ask prof. or TAs
        - Also check if each node always must have M-1 values, or if it can act like a 2,3 tree where it can go 1 value 2 nodes, or 2 values 3 nodes
    [] Build Tree Method ~ Write description for this method
        - Most complex method so make sure to really be sure everything is right
    [] Find Method ~ fix output statements
    [] Print Final List Method ~ Find out if I actually need to keep it or not
    
    [] elaboration as im working through this

[] Match text to given output files
[] Ensure main method matches the one provided
[] Make sure all rules are followed
[] Parts 2 and 3
