Checklist and log notes :)
  X is a check mark

[X] Make sure writing in intro is elaborated on 

[X] make sure exceptions are good

[X] Algorithms under exceptions are made by gpt so make sure they are good and figure out if they are actually needed or if they can be implemented in method
    [X] Figure out what 'Iterator' is cuz idk

[X] complete method logic
    [X] probably going to have to create an output variable to print the output to.
        - Same thing I did as the last project, its pretty simple, but just going through the code and making adjustments will take time
    [X] M variable ~ Check with prof/TAs to see what the proper M is for values and children
    [X] Insert Method ~ look at instructions to see if repeated values are allowed or not (insert method)
    [X] split_node Method ~ I have it splitting into a left and right node at the moment, but I'm not sure if thats right, 
        - Idea: splitting into left and right may not be applicable for all sizes of M, but I'm not 100% sure
            * look through instructions for clarifications, but probably ask prof. or TAs
        - Also check if each node always must have M-1 values, or if it can act like a 2,3 tree where it can go 1 value 2 nodes, or 2 values 3 nodes
    [X] Build Tree Method ~ Write description for this method
        - Most complex method so make sure to really be sure everything is right
    [X] Find Method ~ fix output statements
    [X] Print Final List Method ~ Find out if I actually need to keep it or not
    [X] rewrite description for split_node


[X] Match text to given output files
  - Done for 1, some white space errors, but its probably fine
[X] Ensure main method matches the one provided
[X] Make sure all rules are followed
[X] Make sure all cases work

[X] Change output to single statement instead of cout statements


[X] Write parts 2 and 3 of the project
[X] Take out debug lines
[] If free, try to override exceptions so it keeps going instead of having to pause and play
[X] submit finished version to gradescope

 - I just did the first quick comparison with the actual test case and it seems pretty good, I still need to go through and
   check everything off on the To-Do list, but so far it seems pretty good
 - An issue I'm having is I have to start and stop the running for it to actually do the whole thing, I have no clue why, but it still working
   for whatever reason. I assume its a compiler issue cuz its still works (i think), but there really isn't a way to be sure. I'll do that at some point
 - Still need to change the output so it spits it all out at the end, I don't know if thats an issue with not doing redirect input or its just
   the right way, but I need to do it regardless
 - What I'm realizing is this is just a sorting method for a list, so the output being the same doesn't really mean anything, but then again 
   most of the program is just rearranging the list, so theres no real tell tale way to know if im doing this correctly.
 - I can go more in depth on the outputs to see if there is a difference, and try to relate the stuff to the M-tree structure, but its lack of
   solid definition also makes it difficult to properly know how to do stuff.

 - At the moment case 1 is working with proper outputs, on the text compare website it says there is an error in the final print
   statement but im assuming that its just a white space error.
 - I still need to check if everything works with case 2 and 3 as well as write parts 2 and 3 of the project, but thats teh easy parts
 - AI usage on this project was significantly less pretty much just a general outline, then the algorithms at the beginning along with
   handling the output. Then there was just some basic syntax stuff related to vectors
 - The hardest part so far was probably handling the output since teh string library isn't allowed, I think it just adds everything to a vector
   but its kinda silly
 - Assuming all of the logic is actually correct all I really have to do left is just fix the issue were the compiler stops mid way through
   and I just have to click pause and play to keep it going, along with making sure 2 and 3 match. I also have to write parts 2 and 3, but 
   this is kinda part of that so it won't be that difficult.

11/14/2024 3:47 pm
 - just submitted it to the gradescope to see if it actually works, and it took a while, but it did run and passed for cases 1 and 
   2, 3 did not pass, but thats probably because of the exceptions that I haven't really verified yet. 
 - I'm still going to verify that I'm actually doing this properly, and make sure everything is actually done, but I just wanted to see
   if the code actually ran properly before it was due
 - I also still need to do parts 2 and 3, but thats pretty easy. And comments are already done for most of the code so nothing to worry about there

9:58 pm
 - I have no clue whats wrong. For some reason whenever 122 is inserted 121 is no longer printed out. I have no clue. I've been staring at the same
   like 3 methods for an hours and have no clue whats wrong, I've found exactly where the issue is in the output, i had it print out the values before
   and after insertion as well as before and after the node is split, but this still showed 121 existed. 
 - The only possible explanation for the thing not working is for some reason its overlooked when the tree is rebuilt, but I have no clue why it would
   do that. I've added some debug stuff so hope fully I can fix it tomorrow, but if worst comes to worst I add a specific if statement so it doesn't 
   break in this very specific edge case that exists for apparently no reason.
 - I'm just so confused.

11/15/2024 12:12 pm
 - Issue with the 121 thing has been found, its with the split_node method. BuildTree handles node splitting differently, so when it is done with insertion
   it uses a different thing, so which is where the issue arises.
 - I literally just used the code from build tree and put it in split node to make split node work properly. If everything works and I have a lot of extra time
   I can rework the buildTree method to just use the split_node, but realistically, that ain't happening

11/16/2024 2:09 pm
 - Just submitted the code portion of the project, everything works, so now I'm just going to go through make sure everything complies with the 
   instruction and add the finishing touches to comments, as well as doing parts 2 and 3.

9:48 pm
 - I was going to document throughout the day but I kinda forgot, so 
 - Just finished parts 2 and 3, everything should be done, now its just submitting.
