An M-tree is basically a 2,3 tree. The tree consists of 3 main variables, 'M', 'values', and 'children'. 
Starting with 'M' it means there are M children per node, and 'M-1' values per node; so if M=3 then each node 
contains 2 values and has 3 children nodes. The next is 'values' which simply store the values in that given 
node, its pretty much the _info. The last is 'children' it is a vector of M-tree nodes that are the children of 
the given node. This makes recursion very simple as it makes each node its own tree (method calls work on 
children nodes as well as roots).

Output is handled in a kind of strange way. In previous projects the string library was allowed so I could just 
add everything to a string then print the string. Since it isn't allowed outputs are broken into characters and
put into a vector. Then the vector is outputted, this is described more in detail at its section in the code.
This way of outputting stuff makes the main method look a little messy, but its still the same functionality of
the provided main method.

Lower bound is a method used to find the lowest bound an element can be inserted without breaking the order of 
elements. By using an iterator the method returns a pointer to this element allowing for quicker access and less
work to traverse the following elements as well.

This method is essentially an extension of lowerBound that uses the returned iterator to see if the provided 
value is in the dataset. The actual return statement first checks to make sure the iterator is not past the last 
element of the array, then it checks to see if the value the iterator is pointing to is not less than value. 
This essentially checks if value is == *it since the lower bound finds the first position where the value is not 
less than the given value.

The following few methods are all made to handle the output. Since the string library wasn't allowed I couldn't 
just add the output to a string then output it like normal so this stuff had to be done.

The output is handled by a vector of character. Both numbers(in character form), characters, and new lines are 
put here to properly handle the output.

    Simple remove method, the first if statement is in regards to leaf nodes.

    is greater than all vals in the vector, meaning its not in it, the second statement
    checks to see if the value being pointed to is == to the value. These are both crucial
    in keeping everything defined and correct. it those are both false it deletes the value 
    that position in the values vector.

    recursive call to repeat the above process in teh child node.

    The build tree method is probably one of the more important methods in the MTree class.
    This method constructs an MTree from a given set of elements. It organizes the tree structure 
    by splitting the input values into smaller manageable subtrees through recursion.

    The basic process it goes through is:
        1. Clear the tree
        2. Check to see if the number of values are less than M
             If so make a leaf node and end recursion there
        3. Calculate how many values each child node will have
        4. Actually create the child nodes and input proper amount of values
             find the values that go into that specific child node
             create vector to hold these values
             recursively call to create a new Mtree child node using the sub-vector previously created
             add these newly created children nodes to the children vector
             add the split value; if node is not the last one add the value a the end index to the values vector

part 2 : LLM usage

This project didn't have a lot of LLM usage, the main use was creating a general outline of the code based on the 
instructions along with understanding the logic of certain functions, then a bunch of smaller uses that were used
to understand certain syntax, and how to do certain things, but I tried to rely on actual sources instead of just
going straight to AI. I also used an LLM to figure out tht output I talked about it earlier, but in short; no 
string library -> issues creating output string -> char vector. Then an LLM helped create the char vector methods.
Theres also those algorithms at the beginning that a LLM helped create.

I used Chat-gpt to help with the initial creation since it can read PDFs. But i wanted to try out microsoft's 
copilot LLM because its free, and its unlimited (unlike chat-gpt). It worked pretty well, but its website is kinda
messed up, whenever you try to copy and paste anything it pastes to a single line instead of formatting the way 
it looks on the website. Because of that Ill do my best to reorganize the responses, but I may also end up just
summarizing the response. 

I'll start with chat-gpt then go to microsoft copilot

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Me: 
    Here are the instructions for a project, write an outline for the code that complies with all specifications.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chat-gpt: 
    Here’s the outline and initial structure for the MTree class in C++ based on the instructions from your 
    project file:

    Class Definition and Node Properties: The MTree class should handle the multiway search tree (M-tree) 
    operations: insertion, deletion, search, and rebuilding the tree to maintain balance.

    Methods and Functionality:
        Insertion (insert): Add values to the tree, with node splitting when necessary.
        Deletion (remove): Remove specified values from the tree.
        Search (search and find): Locate values in the tree, traversing nodes by split points.
        Rebuilding (buildTree): Reconstruct the tree from all current values for balance.

    Exception Handling:
        duplicateInsertion if a value already exists.
        NotFoundException if attempting to remove a value not in the tree.

    Here’s a partial implementation to start with, including handling template-based values and some functions:

    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>
    #include <algorithm> // for std::lower_bound

    using namespace std;

    class duplicateInsertion : public exception {
    public:
        const char* what() const noexcept override {
            return "Duplicate insertion error: value already exists in the tree.";
        }
    };

    class NotFoundException : public exception {
    public:
        const char* what() const noexcept override {
            return "Value not found in the tree.";
        }
    };

    template <typename DT>
    class MTree {
    protected:
        int M;
        vector<DT> values;  // M-1 values in non-leaf nodes
        vector<MTree*> children;  // M children

        

    public:
        MTree(int M) : M(M) {}

        ~MTree() {
            for (auto child : children) delete child;
        }
        
        bool is_leaf() const {
            return children.empty();
        }

        void insert(const DT& value) {
            if (find(value)) {
                throw duplicateInsertion();
            }
            // Insert into appropriate leaf and handle splitting if needed
        }

        bool search(const DT& value) {
            if (is_leaf()) {
                // Search in leaf node
                return search(values.begin(), values.end(), value) != values.end();
            } else {
                // Traverse child nodes based on split points
            }
            return false;
        }

        MTree* find_child(const DT& value) {
            // Find the correct child node to navigate to
        }

        void remove(const DT& value) {
            if (!find(value)) {
                throw NotFoundException();
            }
            // Remove value and handle rebalancing
        }

        void split_node() {
            // Split the node if it exceeds capacity (i.e., >= M)
        }

        void buildTree(vector<DT>& input_values) {
            // Build or rebuild the tree from the sorted values
        }

        vector<DT> collect_values() {
            // Collect all leaf node values into a sorted vector
            vector<DT> all_values;
            return all_values;
        }
    };

    The main program will leverage this MTree class and its methods to handle the commands, as specified in your 
    example. Let me know if you need further assistance with specific methods or modifications!

Me: 
    The algorithm library is not allowed, generate the lower_bound method you said is needed so the library
    does not need to be inputted.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Chat-gpt: 

    Here's an implementation of the lower_bound method that avoids the <algorithm> library:

    template <typename Iterator, typename T>
    Iterator custom_lower_bound(Iterator first, Iterator last, const T& value) {
        while (first != last) {
            Iterator mid = first + (last - first) / 2;
            if (*mid < value) {
                first = mid + 1;
            } else {
                last = mid;
            }
        }
        return first;
    }

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

That'll be the only time I put a large code segment since its the only large code segment made by AI. There are 
still a few small ones though.

Next up is the Microsoft copilot usage.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Me: 
    Here is the class I have been working on in C++ called MTree. It was created partially using AI so there are 
    some methods that are confusing, I'm going to ask questions about it so please familiarize yourself with the 
    class. 

    **I also gave it the mostly completed class**

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Copilot: 
    Got it! I’ll familiarize myself with the M-Tree class. Feel free to ask any questions you have. Here’s a 
    quick overview of what I see:

    **Overview of all methods, exception classes and helper functions**

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Various small questions mainly for syntax, and certain questions about method logic, but no code stuff really.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Me: 
    I made some adjustments, but the code is now too long to send. The general idea is i changed all cout into 
    adding to a string. The issue is I am not able to use #include <string>, how can I add integers to the output 
    string without using any additional inputs

    remember the only libraries I'm allowed to use is vector and iostream, how can i add integers to a string only 
    with these 2 includes

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Copilot: 
    Understood! Without the <string> and <sstream> libraries, you can still achieve this by constructing a string 
    manually using std::vector and std::iostream. One approach is to use character arrays or a std::vector<char> 
    to build the string and then concatenate integers by converting them to characters. Here’s how you can do it:

        Using std::vector<char> and std::iostream:

        Example:

            #include <iostream>
            #include <vector>
            using namespace std;

            // Helper function to convert an integer to a character vector
            void intToCharVector(int num, vector<char>& output) {
                if (num == 0) {
                    output.push_back('0');
                    return;
                }

                vector<char> temp;
                bool isNegative = false;

                if (num < 0) {
                    isNegative = true;
                    num = -num;
                }

                while (num > 0) {
                    temp.push_back('0' + num % 10);
                    num /= 10;
                }

                if (isNegative) {
                    temp.push_back('-');
                }

                // Reverse the temp vector and append to output
                for (auto it = temp.rbegin(); it != temp.rend(); ++it) {
                    output.push_back(*it);
                }
            }

            // Helper function to add an integer to a char vector string
            void addIntToOutput(vector<char>& output, int num) {
                intToCharVector(num, output);
                output.push_back(' '); // Add a space after the number
            }

            int main() {
                vector<char> output;

                // Adding integers to the output string
                addIntToOutput(output, 42);
                addIntToOutput(output, 123);
                addIntToOutput(output, -456);
                addIntToOutput(output, 0);

                // Convert vector<char> to string and print
                string result(output.begin(), output.end());
                cout << result << endl;

                return 0;
            }
        
        Explanation:

        intToCharVector Function:

            Converts an integer to a sequence of characters and appends them to the output vector.

            Handles negative numbers and zero appropriately.

            Uses a temporary vector to store the digits in reverse order, then appends them in the correct order.

        addIntToOutput Function:

            Calls intToCharVector to convert the integer to characters.

            Appends a space after the number to separate it from subsequent numbers.

        Main Program:

            Uses addIntToOutput to add integers to the output vector.

            Converts the output vector to a string and prints it.

    This approach avoids using additional libraries while achieving the desired functionality of concatenating 
    integers into a string-like representation.

    Feel free to test this out and modify it as needed. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further 
    adjustments!

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Me: 
    how do i add new lines and spaces to the vector

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Copilot: 
    Adding words, new lines (returns), and spaces to a vector<char> can be done similarly to how we add integers. 
    Let's go through it step by step:

    Adding Words:
        You can simply iterate over each character in the word and push it into the vector<char>.
        Adding Returns (\n for new lines):

        You can directly push the newline character ('\n') into the vector<char>.

    Adding Spaces:
        You can directly push the space character (' ') into the vector<char>.

    Example Code:
        Here's how you can incorporate words, new lines, and spaces into the vector<char>:

            // Helper function to add a word to a char vector
            void addWordToOutput(vector<char>& output, const string& word) {
                for (char c : word) {
                    output.push_back(c);
                }
            }

            // Helper function to add a new line to the output
            void addNewLineToOutput(vector<char>& output) {
                output.push_back('\n');
            }

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Me: 
    can you add another method to add another vector<char> to the end

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Copilot:
    Sure! You can add a method to concatenate another vector<char> to the end of your existing output vector. 
    This is quite straightforward. I'll show you how to add such a method to your MTree class.

        // New helper function to append another vector<char> to the output 
        void appendVectorToOutput(vector<char>& output, const vector<char>& toAppend) {
            output.insert(output.end(), toAppend.begin(), toAppend.end());
        }

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Thats pretty much the extent of the LLM, so now onto part 3.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Part 3: Debugging and testing plan

Specific tests: 
    Pretty much all of my testing was done with debug lines along with comparing the output my code gave with the
    output provided to us. I would simply go sift through the output my code created and compare it for each 
    command along with certain sequences of commands with the provided output code. This is kind of a primitive 
    method of comparison, but it got the job done. I also created a lot, like a lot, of debug lines i used these
    lines along with my knowledge of trees and specifically what I knew about 2,3 trees to figure out if the code
    was working as intended. 
Issues and Resolutions: 
    The first major issue I encountered was how to output the code without the string library. Last project I used
    this library to add statements to a string, this was useful as ai could simply add words, spaces, integers,
    and new lines to the string, so it could all be done in line then simply printed out. But for this project the
    string library was not allowed so I had to find another way to create the output statement. With the 
    assistance of a large language model I found I could add all the necessary elements to a vector in the form of
    characters, then output the vector by simply looping through it. This is definitely a very complicated 
    solution and probably made the program marginally slower, but its a solid solution.

    The next major issue I had was really weird. For some reason cases 1 and 2 both worked with no issue, but in 
    the 3rd case there was an issue with 1 number. For some reason number 121 would disappear when 122 was 
    inserted. I went through pretty much every single method trying to figure out what the issue is, and by pretty
    much every method i mean like every single one. It was a pain trying to track it down I wrote debug statements
    and the way it printed everything showed up fine, but then in the final list it was still gone. After a lot 
    of redundant debug statements and a lot of searching I found that the issue came from the spit_node method. 
    I forgot exactly what I did to fix the problem, but I know the stem of the issue was the root value wasn't 
    saved properly. To resolve the issue I just ripped a lot of the code from the build tree method and put it in
    split node. I made the build tree first since it was more important for getting everything started, which is 
    the main reason why build tree had its own logic in the first place. The replacement of the code almost worked 
    right off the bat, but some adjustment was required to get it working. Overall it was a long winded problem 
    with a relatively simple solution. 
Verification: 
    This is essentially the same as the specific tests question, I just run the provided inputs then I match my 
    outputs with the given outputs. This works well in showing what went wrong and exactly where. Additionally, I
    submitted on gradescope prematurely in order to make sure everything works the way intended by gradescope, as 
    even if it works in my tests it doesn't matter if it doesn't work on the official test. I also had numerous 
    debug statements to ensure everything was functioning properly. The most notable were for the split_node, 
    print_all, and build tree, these debug statements allowed me to see exactly what was happening in each method
    which then allowed me to ensure they were functioning as intended. 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I also made a pretty extensive To-Do List and a log of activity. So if that count for anything I've added it below

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: 

  X is a check mark

[X] Make sure writing in intro is elaborated on 

[X] make sure exceptions are good

[X] Algorithms under exceptions are made by gpt so make sure they are good and figure out if they are actually needed or if they can be implemented in method
    [X] Figure out what 'Iterator' is cuz idk

[X] complete method logic
    [X] probably going to have to create an output variable to print the output to.
        - Same thing I did as the last project, its pretty simple, but just going through the code and making adjustments will take time
    [X] M variable ~ Check with prof/TAs to see what the proper M is for values and children
    [X] Insert Method ~ look at instructions to see if repeated values are allowed or not (insert method)
    [X] split_node Method ~ I have it splitting into a left and right node at the moment, but I'm not sure if thats right, 
        - Idea: splitting into left and right may not be applicable for all sizes of M, but I'm not 100% sure
            * look through instructions for clarifications, but probably ask prof. or TAs
        - Also check if each node always must have M-1 values, or if it can act like a 2,3 tree where it can go 1 value 2 nodes, or 2 values 3 nodes
    [X] Build Tree Method ~ Write description for this method
        - Most complex method so make sure to really be sure everything is right
    [X] Find Method ~ fix output statements
    [X] Print Final List Method ~ Find out if I actually need to keep it or not
    [X] rewrite description for split_node


[X] Match text to given output files
  - Done for 1, some white space errors, but its probably fine
[X] Ensure main method matches the one provided
[X] Make sure all rules are followed
[X] Make sure all cases work

[X] Change output to single statement instead of cout statements


[X] Write parts 2 and 3 of the project
[X] Take out debug lines
[] If free, try to override exceptions so it keeps going instead of having to pause and play
[X] submit finished version to gradescope

 - I just did the first quick comparison with the actual test case and it seems pretty good, I still need to go through and
   check everything off on the To-Do list, but so far it seems pretty good
 - An issue I'm having is I have to start and stop the running for it to actually do the whole thing, I have no clue why, but it still working
   for whatever reason. I assume its a compiler issue cuz its still works (i think), but there really isn't a way to be sure. I'll do that at some point
 - Still need to change the output so it spits it all out at the end, I don't know if thats an issue with not doing redirect input or its just
   the right way, but I need to do it regardless
 - What I'm realizing is this is just a sorting method for a list, so the output being the same doesn't really mean anything, but then again 
   most of the program is just rearranging the list, so theres no real tell tale way to know if im doing this correctly.
 - I can go more in depth on the outputs to see if there is a difference, and try to relate the stuff to the M-tree structure, but its lack of
   solid definition also makes it difficult to properly know how to do stuff. 


11/13/2024 8:51 pm
 - At the moment case 1 is working with proper outputs, on the text compare website it says there is an error in the final print
   statement but im assuming that its just a white space error.
 - I still need to check if everything works with case 2 and 3 as well as write parts 2 and 3 of the project, but thats teh easy parts
 - AI usage on this project was significantly less pretty much just a general outline, then the algorithms at the beginning along with
   handling the output. Then there was just some basic syntax stuff related to vectors
 - The hardest part so far was probably handling the output since teh string library isn't allowed, I think it just adds everything to a vector
   but its kinda silly
 - Assuming all of the logic is actually correct all I really have to do left is just fix the issue were the compiler stops mid way through
   and I just have to click pause and play to keep it going, along with making sure 2 and 3 match. I also have to write parts 2 and 3, but 
   this is kinda part of that so it won't be that difficult.

11/14/2024 3:47 pm
 - just submitted it to the gradescope to see if it actually works, and it took a while, but it did run and passed for cases 1 and 
   2, 3 did not pass, but thats probably because of the exceptions that I haven't really verified yet. 
 - I'm still going to verify that I'm actually doing this properly, and make sure everything is actually done, but I just wanted to see
   if the code actually ran properly before it was due
 - I also still need to do parts 2 and 3, but thats pretty easy. And comments are already done for most of the code so nothing to worry about there

9:58 pm
 - I have no clue whats wrong. For some reason whenever 122 is inserted 121 is no longer printed out. I have no clue. I've been staring at the same
   like 3 methods for an hours and have no clue whats wrong, I've found exactly where the issue is in the output, i had it print out the values before
   and after insertion as well as before and after the node is split, but this still showed 121 existed. 
 - The only possible explanation for the thing not working is for some reason its overlooked when the tree is rebuilt, but I have no clue why it would
   do that. I've added some debug stuff so hope fully I can fix it tomorrow, but if worst comes to worst I add a specific if statement so it doesn't 
   break in this very specific edge case that exists for apparently no reason.
 - I'm just so confused.

 - Issue with the 121 thing has been found, its with the split_node method. BuildTree handles node splitting differently, so when it is done with insertion
   it uses a different thing, so which is where the issue arises.
 - I literally just used the code from build tree and put it in split node to make split node work properly. If everything works and I have a lot of extra time
   I can rework the buildTree method to just use the split_node, but realistically, that ain't happening

 - Just submitted the code portion of the project, everything works, so now I'm just going to go through make sure everything complies with the 
   instruction and add the finishing touches to comments, as well as doing parts 2 and 3.

 - I was going to document throughout the day but I kinda forgot, so 
 - Just finished parts 2 and 3, everything should be done, now its just submitting.
